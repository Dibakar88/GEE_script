Step-by-Step Methods to Find Rare or Invisible Pixels

âœ… 1. Use the Raster Calculator to Isolate the Value
  
  If you know or suspect the pixel value (e.g., a rare outlier like 9999 or -0.1234):

  Steps:

  Go to Raster > Raster Calculator

  Use an expression like:
  "your_raster@1" = 9999

  or, for float values:
  abs("your_raster@1" - (-0.1234)) < 0.00001


  Set an output layer name and run.

âœ… You will get a binary raster:

1 = pixel matches the value

0 = all other pixels

ðŸ§  This makes even rare pixels visible.
